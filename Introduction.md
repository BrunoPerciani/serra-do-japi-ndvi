# NDVI and precipitation graphic analysis – Serra do Japi, Jundiaí, São Paulo (SP) - (2013–2023)

This repository contains the source code and data visualization scripts developed for the scientific study on the conservation of the Serra do Japi ecological reserve, located in Jundiaí, São Paulo, Brazil. The analysis focuses on the temporal behavior of the **Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)** and **annual precipitation** between 2013 and 2023.

## 📄 About the study

The study employs remote sensing and geospatial analysis techniques to assess the conservation effectiveness of Serra do Japi, a preserved remnant of the Atlantic Forest. The NDVI values were derived from **Landsat-8 imagery**, and precipitation data were obtained from the **CHIRPS** (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation) dataset.

The graphs generated in this notebook supported the interpretation of long-term vegetation stability and its correlation with climatic patterns, as part of the results presented in the article submitted to the *Revista Brasileira de Cartografia*.
